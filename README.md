# Robot Simulation

This repository contains a Python-based simulation for an autonomous robot navigating a warehouse environment. The project demonstrates obstacle avoidance using dynamic and static elements. It includes a simulation file (`robot_simulation.py`) that visualizes the robot's movements and interactions within the warehouse layout, and a `requirements.txt` file listing the necessary libraries for running the simulation.

## Features
- Visual representation of the robot's navigation.
- Dynamic obstacle simulation (e.g., moving person).
- Static obstacles within the warehouse.
- Easy setup and execution with Python.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries specified in `requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run `robot_simulation.py` to start the simulation.
