# Robot_Simulation
This Python project simulates an autonomous robot navigating a warehouse! It lets robots dodge both stationary (static) and moving (dynamic) obstacles. The core file, "robot_simulation.py," uses visuals to show the robot's path and interactions within the warehouse layout. To run it, you'll need the libraries listed in "requirements.txt."
